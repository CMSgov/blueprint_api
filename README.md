# Blueprint API

Please visit the infrastructure repo for setting up a local development environment at <https://github.com/CMSgov/blueprint_infra>

## Contributing

Ensure that you have installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) on your machine and that you have instantiated pre-commit in the **Blueprint API** repository by running `pre-commit install` in the root of your local copy of the repo.

Once you have _pre-commit_ installed _pre-commit hooks_ will run each time that you do a git commit. _Pre-commit_ will try to resolve many issues, but you will be required to resolve those that it cannot before pushing your code.
