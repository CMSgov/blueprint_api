CMS IDM solution use API to coordinate activities which utilizes Okta  and IDM HUB API services for authentication and authorization in order to manage user access privileges by controlling users, roles, accounts, and entitlements. IDM solution provides the functionalities for provisioning, identity and role administration, request and approval management, policy-based entitlement management, password expiration/warning, and audit and compliance.\n IDM ensures that inactive accounts are disabled per the guidelines provided in the Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS). IDM do not make provision for emergency or temporary accounts.\n The IDM solution identifies and selects individual and system/application accounts to support organizational missions/business functions. Conditions for role membership is defined by CMS and enforced by IDM.  IDM specifies authorized users and role membership, access authorizations, and other attributes for each account. Request to create system accounts requires approval by the IDM business owner. IDM complies with ARS when creating, enabling, modifying, disabling, and removing system accounts. IDM accounts are monitored, and account managers are notified when accounts are no longer required, users are terminated or transferred, and/or for individual need-to-know changes. IDM authorizes access based on a valid access authorization, intended system usage, and other reasons as required by CMS missions and business functions.\n CMS ARS AC-2(f) requires inactive accounts be removed in accordance with Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS) requirements and Risk Management Handbook (RMH) standards and procedures.  CMS IDM system meets the requirements by providing an inheritable control to downstream applications that will de-provision accounts according to the following criteria:\n -Accounts with no roles and more than one year of inactivity.  -Accounts with roles and more than two years of inactivity.  -Accounts for out-of-scope applications that includes  FFM, Agent and brokers, Assisters, have their own account review procedures and have more than three years of inactivity. Account removal is performed in coordination with the application team.\n Vertical applications teams should validate the continued use of the user's role in their application. \n Hybrid control - where application finds that user should no longer have a role, the application team is responsible for removing said role. IDM will only provides the tools needed by the application to identify the compliance status of the user and record their annual account review decision. IDM give applications a place to record their decision. IDM no longer takes responsibility for the application failure to exercise their due diligence.\n The IDM solution reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements at least every 90 days and establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials when individuals are removed from the group.\n PRIV.1 \u2013 The IDM Solution does not allow the use of guest, anonymous, and shared accounts for providing access to PII.\n PRIV.2 \u2013 The IDM solution ensures account managers are notified immediately when temporary accounts are no longer required, or when information system users are terminated, transferred, or information system usage for need-to-know/need-to-share changes.\n PRIV.3 \u2013 User roles with the need-to-know are allowed access for PII to perform user\u2019s duties only after explicitly approved by the Business Owner (BO), or an authorized approver. The approval commensurate with users justifications.\n PRIV.4 \u2013 Access controls within the IDM solution is implemented based on users\u2019 or user group\u2019s need for access to PII in the performance of specified duties.\n PRIV.5 \u2013 The IDM solution provides access only to the minimum amount of PII necessary for users to perform their duties.\n PRIV.6 \u2013 IDM solution creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes accounts in accordance with the requirement for each user to complete privacy training every 365 days, otherwise the account will be disabled.",
