# Supported Catalogs
The following catalogs are sourced from https://github.com/CMSgov/ars-machine-readable .
These catalogs are ingested into the blueprint database during deployment, and should not be modified. 
Projects should be associated with a single catalog dataset given a catalog version and impact level 
("high", "moderate", "low").

## Version 3.1 (current)
- CMS_ARS_3_1_[HIGH, MODERATE, LOW]_baseline_catalog.json
